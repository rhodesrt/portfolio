      <p>
        I graduated from Whitman College with a degree in Biology. I started
        learning web development in early 2021 when I completed Harvard's
        introductory computer science course, CS50. I then began learning
        full-stack Javascript using The Odin Project's open source curriculum.
        Along the way, I have built apps using HTML/CSS, JS/React/Node.js,
        MongoDB, SQLite, and various other tooling technologies.

    </div>
